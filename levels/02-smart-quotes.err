# Level 02: Smart Quotes
# Lesson: E0007 - Unicode and text encoding
#
# OBJECTIVE: Understand why smart quotes break code.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Run this program a few times
# 2. Eventually E0007 will be injected
# 3. Learn about character encoding
#
# REAL-WORLD TIP:
# This happens when you copy code from:
# - Word documents
# - Slack/Discord messages
# - Some websites
# - PDF files

main
    println("Level 02: Smart Quotes")

    # These are CORRECT straight quotes:
    let good1 = "Hello"
    let good2 = "World"

    gutter
        # These might become WRONG curly quotes:
        let bad1 = "Smart quotes"
        let bad2 = "are sneaky"
        # The error injector may turn " into " or "
    end

    println("Straight quotes: ", good1, good2)
    println("Level 02 complete!")
end
