# Level 01: Hello World
# Lesson: Your first Error-Lang program
#
# OBJECTIVE: Run this program and observe the error.
#            Then use `error-lang explain` to understand it.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Run: error-lang run levels/01-hello-world.err
# 2. Note the error code (e.g., E0002)
# 3. Run: error-lang explain E0002
# 4. The program still outputs despite errors!

main
    println("Welcome to Error-Lang!")
    println("This is Level 01.")

    gutter
        # An error WILL be injected here
        # Don't worry - that's the point!
        let broken = "this is intentionally broken
    end

    println("You made it to the end!")
    println("Level 01 complete!")
end
